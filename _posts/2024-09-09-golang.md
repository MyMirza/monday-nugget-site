### [Statically and Dynamically Linked Go Binaries](https://packagemain.tech/p/golang-statically-and-dynamically-linked-binaries)

Imagine we're sipping coffee and discussing Go's compiler, which is a powerhouse for cross-platform compilation. However, there's a twist: you can compile your Go program in different ways, resulting in either statically or dynamically linked executables.

**Static linking** bundles all necessary libraries into the final executable, making it highly portable. Your binary can run anywhere without worrying about missing libraries.

**Dynamic linking**, on the other hand, links libraries at runtime. This can save space and allow you to benefit from system updates without recompiling your program.

Here's a quick way to check if your Go binary is statically or dynamically linked:
```sh
file your_binary
ldd your_binary
```

For static linking, especially if you're using cgo (which calls C code), you can disable it with:
```sh
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build
```

This ensures your binary is fully self-contained.

Go also has an internal linker but can use external ones like `gcc`'s `ld` for more control. However, be cautious with libraries like `libnss` that can't be statically linked.

Cross-compilation is another strong suit of Go, but it gets tricky with cgo. Best to avoid cgo for smooth cross-compiling.

Lastly, you can strip debug info to reduce binary size:
```sh
go build -ldflags="-w -s"
```

And watch out for the `LD_PRELOAD` trick in dynamically linked binariesâ€”it can inject custom code, which is a security risk. Static binaries don't have this issue.

So, Go's compilation options give you flexibility, but knowing when to use static vs dynamic linking is key for portability and security.

### [Telemetry in Go 1.23 and Beyond](https://go.dev/blog/gotelemetry)

Go 1.23 introduces telemetry to enhance the Go toolchain by allowing users to share data about toolchain programs. This data helps fix bugs and make better decisions. By default, telemetry data is stored locally, but users can enable uploading with `go telemetry on` and disable it with `go telemetry off`. The initial design required explicit user consent for remote uploading. Telemetry was first implemented in the Go language server `gopls` in October 2023, and early adopters helped identify bugs. To increase participation, a prompt was added to the VS Code Go plugin, growing the sample size to around 1800 weekly participants. Telemetry has proven useful in identifying and fixing bugs, and future plans include expanding telemetry to other tools and improving user experience metrics. Automated crash reporting is also introduced in Go 1.23 with the `runtime.SetCrashOutput` API. Telemetry will play a crucial role in the continued growth and improvement of Go.

```go
// Enable telemetry
go telemetry on

// Disable telemetry
go telemetry off
```

# [Reading Google Sheets from a Go Program](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2024/reading-google-sheets-from-a-go-program/)

This post discusses methods to process data from a Google Sheet in a Go program, focusing on using a service account and OAuth 2.0 for authentication. To use the Sheets API, you need a GCP project and the gcloud command-line tool to enable the API. The simplest method involves creating a service account, downloading its private key, and using it to authenticate and access the Sheets API. The provided Go code demonstrates reading the key file, setting up JWT configuration, and retrieving data from a specified Google Sheet. The post also briefly mentions an alternative OAuth 2.0 approach, which requires initial setup in the GCP console and handles token exchange automatically. Additionally, the author notes that Application Default Credentials (ADC) can also be used, though they initially faced issues with it. The full code for all methods is available on GitHub.

Snippet:
```go
package main

import (
  "context"
  "flag"
  "fmt"
  "io/ioutil"
  "log"

  "golang.org/x/oauth2/google"
  "google.golang.org/api/option"
  "google.golang.org/api/sheets/v4"
)

func main() {
  keyFilePath := flag.String("keyfile", "", "path to the credentials file")
  flag.Parse()

  ctx := context.Background()
  credentials, err := ioutil.ReadFile(*keyFilePath)
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatal("unable to read key file:", err)
  }

  scopes := []string{
    "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets.readonly",
  }
  config, err := google.JWTConfigFromJSON(credentials, scopes...)
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatal("unable to create JWT configuration:", err)
  }

  srv, err := sheets.NewService(ctx, option.WithHTTPClient(config.Client(ctx)))
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("unable to retrieve sheets service: %v", err)
  }

  docId := "1qsNWsZuw98r9HEl01vwxCO5O1sIsI-fr0bJ4KGVvWsU"
  doc, err := srv.Spreadsheets.Get(docId).Do()
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("unable to retrieve data from document: %v", err)
  }
  fmt.Printf("The title of the doc is: %s\n", doc.Properties.Title)

  val, err := srv.Spreadsheets.Values.Get(docId, "Sheet1!A:B").Do()
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("unable to retrieve range from document: %v", err)
  }

  fmt.Printf("Selected major dimension=%v, range=%v\n", val.MajorDimension, val.Range)
  for _, row := range val.Values {
    fmt.Println(row)
  }
}
```

### [The Developer's Guide to Database Proxies: When to Use Them and How to Create One](https://packagemain.tech/p/the-developers-guide-to-database)

A Database Proxy acts as a middle layer between applications and databases, simplifying complex systems by handling tasks like query routing, validation, and security. It isolates database details from developers, allowing for easier schema changes and better security. Use cases include intercepting and routing SQL queries, enforcing security policies, and improving performance through connection pooling. However, it adds complexity and potential latency. A simple Go example demonstrates a proxy that rewrites SQL queries to route from one table to another. Here's a basic implementation:

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "io"
  "log"
  "net"
  "os"
)

func main() {
  proxy, err := net.Listen("tcp", ":3307")
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("failed to start proxy: %s", err.Error())
  }

  for {
    conn, err := proxy.Accept()
    if err != nil {
      log.Fatalf("failed to accept connection: %s", err.Error())
    }
    go transport(conn)
  }
}

func transport(conn net.Conn) {
  defer conn.Close()
  mysqlAddr := fmt.Sprintf("%s:%s", os.Getenv("MYSQL_HOST"), os.Getenv("MYSQL_PORT"))
  mysqlConn, err := net.Dial("tcp", mysqlAddr)
  if err != nil {
    log.Printf("failed to connect to mysql: %s", err.Error())
    return
  }
  go pipe(mysqlConn, conn, true)
  go pipe(conn, mysqlConn, false)
}

func pipe(dst, src net.Conn, send bool) {
  if send {
    intercept(src, dst)
  }
  _, err := io.Copy(dst, src)
  if err != nil {
    log.Printf("connection error: %s", err.Error())
  }
}

const COM_QUERY = byte(0x03)

func intercept(src, dst net.Conn) {
  buffer := make([]byte, 4096)
  for {
    n, _ := src.Read(buffer)
    if n > 5 && buffer[4] == COM_QUERY {
      clientQuery := string(buffer[5:n])
      newQuery := strings.Replace(strings.ToLower(clientQuery), "from orders_v1", "from orders_v2", -1)
      fmt.Printf("client query: %s\n", clientQuery)
      fmt.Printf("server query: %s\n", newQuery)
      writeModifiedPacket(dst, buffer[:5], newQuery)
      continue
    }
    dst.Write(buffer[0:n])
  }
}

func writeModifiedPacket(dst net.Conn, header []byte, query string) {
  newBuffer := make([]byte, 5+len(query))
  copy(newBuffer, header)
  copy(newBuffer[5:], []byte(query))
  dst.Write(newBuffer)
}
```

This proxy listens on port 3307, intercepts SQL queries, and rewrites them before forwarding to MySQL.
