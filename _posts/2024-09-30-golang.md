### [Writing Effective Unit Tests in Golang: A Practical Guide](https://medium.com/@abhijith0807/writing-effective-unit-tests-in-golang-a-practical-guide-0d24444769f6?source=rss------golang-5)

Imagine you're constructing a house and need to ensure each brick is solid before stacking them. That's the role of unit testing in your code. In Golang, the built-in `testing` package simplifies writing these tests. You can also utilize mocking frameworks like `gomock`, `testify`, and `bounegru/monkey` to simulate dependencies and verify your code in isolation. This practice helps catch bugs early, enhances code quality, and makes your software easier to maintain. Here's a quick example to get you started:

```go
import "testing"

func TestAdd(t *testing.T) {
    result := Add(2, 3)
    if result != 5 {
        t.Errorf("Expected 5, got %d", result)
    }
}
```

This snippet tests a simple `Add` function to ensure it returns the correct sum.

### [Golang: Some batteries not included (2021)](https://yolken.net/blog/golang-batteries-not-included)

Here's the essential information about using Go (Golang) and its standard library, along with the necessary third-party libraries to fill in the gaps:

1. **Flags**: Go’s built-in `flag` package is basic. For better flag handling, use:
   - **cobra**: Popular and robust.
   - **segmentio/cli**: Simple and easy for basic CLIs.

2. **Logging**: The standard `log` package lacks features like log levels and structured output. Alternatives include:
   - **logrus**: Supports log levels and structured formats.
   - **segmentio/events**: Great for structured logging in backend systems.

3. **Testing**: Go’s testing lacks assert functions. Use:
   - **testify**: Provides `assert` and `require` functions for cleaner tests.

4. **YAML Handling**: Go doesn’t support YAML natively. Use:
   - **go-yaml**: Standard for YAML parsing.
   - **ghodss/yaml**: Wraps `go-yaml` and supports JSON-compatible tags.

5. **Asset Embedding**: For embedding static assets in binaries, use:
   - **go-bindata**: Embeds assets into Go files for easy inclusion in binaries.

Here’s a quick code snippet for using `logrus`:

```go
import (
    log "github.com/sirupsen/logrus"
)

func main() {
    log.Info("This is an info message")
    log.Debug("This is a debug message")
}
```

Remember, Go’s standard library is solid but sometimes you need these third-party tools to make your life easier.

### [How Go Tests "go test"](https://atlasgo.io/blog/2024/09/09/how-go-tests-go-test)

Here's the distilled essence of the post:

1. **CLI Tools in 2024**: If you're a software engineer, you're likely using CLI tools like Docker, kubectl, Terraform, or Atlas (a database schema management tool written in Go).

2. **Testing CLI Tools**: Testing CLI tools involves unique challenges but follows the same basic phases as other software tests: Arrange, Act, Assert, and Cleanup.

3. **Go's Evolution in Testing**:
   - **Early Days**: Initially, Go's CLI tool was tested using a large shell script (`test.bash`), which became cumbersome.
   - **2015 Shift**: Introduced `go_test.go` with the `testgo` framework, making tests more manageable and compatible across platforms.
   - **2018 Upgrade**: Introduced `script_test.go`, a new framework using a shell-like language for writing tests, encapsulated in `txtar` archives.

4. **Testscript Package**: Roger Peppe created the `testscript` package, based on `script_test.go`, making it accessible for broader use. It allows writing tests in a shell-like language, running them in parallel, and automatic cleanup.

5. **Practical Example**: Demonstrated using `testscript` to test a simple CLI tool named `wordwrap`. The tool wraps text files at a specified width, and tests verify its behavior using custom commands.

6. **Impact on Atlas**: The Atlas team uses `testscript` extensively, creating custom commands to streamline their testing process, ensuring high reliability and quality of their schema management tool.

Here’s a quick code snippet to illustrate how `testscript` is used:

```go
// wordwrap_test.go
package main

import (
    "testing"
    "github.com/rogpeppe/go-internal/testscript"
)

func TestScript(t *testing.T) {
    testscript.Run(t, testscript.Params{
        Dir: "testdata",
        // Register custom commands if any
        Setup: func(env *testscript.Env) error {
            env.Setenv("CUSTOM_VAR", "value")
            return nil
        },
    })
}
```

This snippet sets up a basic test environment using `testscript`, allowing you to write and run shell-like test scripts for your CLI tool.

### [Register allocation in the Go compiler](https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2024/09/24/go-compiler-register-allocation)

The post discusses the Go compiler's register allocator (RA), detailing its components, processes, and optimizations. Key points include the necessity of critical edge elimination in the control flow graph (CFG), the handling of SSA values, and the allocation of registers and stack slots. The Go RA processes basic blocks in CFG preorder and uses heuristics based on the longest distance to the next use for spilling values. It employs techniques like value rematerialization, register shuffling, and handling SSA Phis to ensure correct value allocation. The RA also integrates stack slot allocation, leveraging a conflict graph to optimize stack usage. The Go RA uses 64-bit masks for registers and maintains SSA values mapped to registers, employing special operations like StoreReg and LoadReg. The post compares Go's RA to other methods like linear scan and second-chance bin-packing, noting its local scope with some global optimizations. The Go RA assumes all registers are clobbered by calls, which can lead to inefficient code, but suggests using call-saved registers for better performance. The post concludes by highlighting the advantages and drawbacks of the current Go RA.

```go
// Example of handling SSA values in Go RA
func regalloc() {
    for _, bb := range cfg.preorder() {
        for _, v := range bb.values {
            if !v.needsReg() {
                continue
            }
            reg := findFreeReg(v)
            if reg == -1 {
                spillValue(v)
            } else {
                assignReg(v, reg)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### [Database migrations in Kubernetes](https://packagemain.tech/p/database-migrations-in-kubernetes)

Managing database migrations in a Kubernetes environment is complex due to challenges like multiple replicas starting simultaneously and the need for coordination. Traditional methods of running migrations during application startup are insufficient. Popular Golang tools for migrations include golang-migrate, goose, and atlas. A naive approach is to run migrations inside the main function, but this can cause issues like slow migrations leading to pod failures. Better solutions include using initContainers to run migrations before the main application starts, creating a separate Kubernetes Job for migrations, or using Helm hooks for pre-install or pre-upgrade migrations. Best practices involve decoupling migrations from application code, using version control, ensuring idempotent migrations, implementing rollback strategies, and monitoring migrations. Here's an example of running migrations inside your code using golang-migrate:

```go
package main

import (
    "database/sql"
    "fmt"
    "log"
    "net/http"

    "github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4"
    "github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4/database/postgres"
    _ "github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4/source/file"
    _ "github.com/lib/pq"
)

func main() {
    url := "postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/dbname"
    db, err := sql.Open("postgres", url)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("could not connect to database: %v", err)
    }
    defer db.Close()

    if err := runMigrations(db); err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("could not run migrations: %v", err)
    }

    if err := http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil); err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("server failed to start: %v", err)
    }
}

func runMigrations(db *sql.DB) error {
    driver, err := postgres.WithInstance(db, &postgres.Config{})
    if err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("could not create database driver: %w", err)
    }

    m, err := migrate.NewWithDatabaseInstance(
        "file://migrations",
        "postgres",
        driver,
    )
    if err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("could not create migrate instance: %w", err)
    }

    if err := m.Up(); err != nil && err != migrate.ErrNoChange {
        return fmt.Errorf("could not run migrations: %w", err)
    }

    log.Println("migrations completed successfully")
    return nil
}
```

By following these strategies and best practices, you can ensure smooth and efficient database migrations in your Kubernetes-based architecture.

### [Prep: Golang Comptime](https://github.com/pijng/prep)

The content discusses "prep," a small Go tool that enables compile-time function evaluation, similar to Zig's comptime. To use prep, install it as a binary executable and add it to your Go project via Go modules. Functions intended for compile-time evaluation should be wrapped with `prep.Comptime`. During the build process, use the `-toolexec` flag to evaluate these functions and replace them with their computed results. Currently, prep supports only basic literals as arguments, meaning functions must be fully resolvable with provided literal arguments and cannot use values from IO operations.

```go
import "github.com/yourusername/prep"

func main() {
    result := prep.Comptime(fibonacci(10))
    fmt.Println(result)
}
```
