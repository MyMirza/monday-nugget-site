### [Building Package-Level, Runtime Configurable Logging ala log4j in Go](https://dolthub.com/blog/2024-09-13-package-scoped-logging-in-go-log4j/)

This post explores the author's preference for Go over Java, with the exception of missing Java's package-level logging configuration feature found in log4j. The author highlights the advantages of package-level logging, which enables detailed logging for specific code sections without recompiling. To replicate this in Go, the author develops prototypes using two popular Go logging frameworks: Zap and Logrus. The Zap prototype employs the `zapfilter` package to filter logs based on logger names, while the Logrus prototype utilizes hooks to filter logs based on the runtime stack. Both solutions allow for altering logging behavior through configuration files. The author notes that Zap is significantly faster than Logrus but mentions that Zap's performance decreases if `Sync()` is called frequently. The post concludes with a suggestion to enhance Zap's ergonomics by extending `zapfilter` to filter logs based on file names or functions. Full prototypes are available on GitHub, and the author welcomes feedback on the concept of package-level logging configuration for Go.

Snippet from the Zap prototype:
```go
func InitFromFile(configFile string) {
	file, err := os.ReadFile(configFile)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	filterRules = zapfilter.MustParseRules(string(file))
}

func NewProductionLogger(namespace string) *zap.Logger {
	config := zap.NewProductionConfig()
	config.OutputPaths = []string{"output.log"}
	config.Sampling = nil
	config.Level = zap.NewAtomicLevelAt(zap.DebugLevel)

	underlying, err := config.Build()
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	return zap.New(zapfilter.NewFilteringCore(underlying.Core(), filterRules)).Named(namespace)
}
```

### [Notes on Running Go in the Browser with WebAssembly](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2024/notes-on-running-go-in-the-browser-with-webassembly/)

The author shares their experience of compiling Go to WebAssembly (WASM) to run in browsers for various projects, finding it an exciting endeavor. WebAssembly enables running Go code in the browser, which is beneficial for reusing existing Go projects. The post summarizes useful patterns for running Go in the browser via WASM, demonstrated with small programs in a GitHub repository.

### Basics: Calling Go from JS
A Go function `calcHarmonic` is created to calculate the harmonic series and export it to JS:
```go
func calcHarmonic(nsecs float64) string {
  // ... calculation logic ...
  return r1.FloatString(40)
}

func main() {
  js.Global().Set("calcHarmonic", jsCalcHarmonic)
  select {}
}

var jsCalcHarmonic = js.FuncOf(func(this js.Value, args []js.Value) any {
  s := calcHarmonic(args[0].Float())
  return js.ValueOf(s)
})
```
Compile with:
```sh
GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build -o harmonic.wasm harmonic.go
```
Load in JS:
```js
const go = new Go();
WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(fetch("harmonic.wasm"), go.importObject).then(
    (result) => { go.run(result.instance); }
);
```
Call from JS:
```js
document.getElementById("submitButton").addEventListener("click", () => {
    let input = document.getElementById("timeInput").value;
    let s = calcHarmonic(parseFloat(input));
    document.getElementById("outputDiv").innerText = s;
});
```
Include `wasm_exec.js` from the Go project.

### DOM Manipulation from Go
More logic is moved to Go:
```go
func main() {
  doc := js.Global().Get("document")
  buttonElement := doc.Call("getElementById", "submitButton")
  inputElement := doc.Call("getElementById", "timeInput")
  outputElement := doc.Call("getElementById", "outputDiv")

  buttonElement.Call("addEventListener", "click", js.FuncOf(
    func(this js.Value, args []js.Value) any {
      input := inputElement.Get("value")
      inputFloat, _ := strconv.ParseFloat(input.String(), 64)
      s := calcHarmonic(inputFloat)
      outputElement.Set("innerText", s)
      return nil
    }))

  select {}
}
```
Only the WebAssembly loader remains in JS.

### Using TinyGo
TinyGo produces smaller WASM binaries but has limitations like slower compilation and lack of support for some stdlib packages. Use TinyGo for smaller, faster-loading binaries.

### WebAssembly in a Web Worker
To keep the main thread free, Web Workers are used:
```js
const worker = new Worker("worker.js");
worker.onmessage = ({ data }) => {
    if (data.action === "result") resultReady(data.payload);
};
```
`worker.js`:
```js
importScripts("wasm_exec.js");
const go = new Go();
WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(fetch("harmonic.wasm"), go.importObject).then(
    (result) => { go.run(result.instance); }
);

onmessage = ({ data }) => {
    if (data.action === "calculate") {
        let result = calcHarmonic(data.payload);
        postMessage({ action: "result", payload: result });
    }
};
```
This approach keeps the UI responsive while computations run in the background.

### [Building LLM-Powered Applications in Go](https://go.dev/blog/llmpowered)

Imagine this: you're enjoying your coffee, and here are the essentials on building LLM-powered apps in Go. Here's the lowdown:

1. **LLMs as Network Services**: LLMs (like OpenAI, Google Gemini) require substantial compute power, so they're typically accessed via APIs. Even DIY LLMs use REST APIs.
2. **Go’s Strengths**: Go is ideal for these applications due to its excellence in REST/RPC protocols, concurrency, and performance.
3. **RAG Server**: We're discussing a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) server in Go. It performs two functions:
   - **Add Documents**: Users can add documents to a knowledge base.
   - **Ask Questions**: Users can query the knowledge base, and the server uses an LLM to provide answers.
4. **Components**:
   - **Embedding Model**: Converts text to vector embeddings.
   - **Vector Database**: Stores and retrieves these embeddings.
   - **LLM**: Answers questions using the context from the knowledge base.
5. **Endpoints**:
   - `/add/`: Adds documents.
   - `/query/`: Queries the knowledge base.

Here's a quick Go snippet for setting up routes:
```go
mux := http.NewServeMux()
mux.HandleFunc("POST /add/", server.addDocumentsHandler)
mux.HandleFunc("POST /query/", server.queryHandler)
```
6. **Concurrency**: Go’s goroutines efficiently handle multiple requests.
7. **Batch APIs**: For efficiency, batch processing is used for embeddings and database operations.

**Variants**:
- **Direct API Use**: Utilizes Google Gemini and Weaviate directly.
- **LangChainGo**: A framework that simplifies switching between different LLM and vector DB providers.
- **Genkit for Go**: Focuses on production features like prompt management and deployment.

In essence, Go makes it straightforward to build scalable, efficient LLM-powered applications with minimal code. Perfect for cloud-native environments.
